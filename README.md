# advent-of-code-2021
A log of my solutions to the 2021 advent of code event (as time permits).

Each problem from each day was treated as an isolated project.
As such, no work was put into refactoring between "days" or even part 1 & 2 of each day.

The goal was to gain more exposure to modern C++ and have some fun!
